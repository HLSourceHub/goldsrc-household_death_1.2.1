to use the lightning; add one weather_genie in the map somewhere (preferably outside) and scatter litnodes around  (not too many)
adjust the amount of light they create as necessary.

tick the first spawnflag for T&L in the weather_genie entity.

then use hdrad.exe instead of regular hlrad.
(technicals: weather_genie and litnodes are basically point lights. hdrad and the mod [1.1.2+] take care of the rest.)

note: the rest of the weather genie functions aren't included in HHD, only the sound/lightning.
