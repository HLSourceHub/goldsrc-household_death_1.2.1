-------------------------------

Miscellaneous Changes:
----------------------
- added "chat" command "/stuck":
 | if you find yourself stuff, press your talk key and type /stuck and press enter.
 | if you are stuck inside an object you will respawn at another location.
- changed rune spawnpoint location system, previously created runespawns will now float in the air and should be re-created.
 | you can now create runespawns ontop of brush and point entities such as func_wall or models.

Gameplay/Weapon Changes:
------------------------
| lowered max lego count to 3
| re-added self-damage (splash) on lego/soda but made it only do 30% damage
- added 3 more runes:
 | Infinite Ammo - Lasts 30 seconds 
 | Vampire - gives you 25% of the damage whoever you hit actually took (after armor/defense deduction)
 | Slasher! - Perm till death, Special. *egrin*
- Added the ability to pickup thrown knives/forks (press +use on them)
- decreased length of time between fork stabs (primary attack)
- decreased length of time between knife throws
- runes no longer visually attach to the player (except Slasher! and Infinite Ammo) instead:
 | double damage makes a sound when attacking
 | defense makes a sound when taking damage
 | haste adds a trail (read below) effect to the player using it
 | homing creates special trails (read below) on the projectiles thrown/launched
 | vampire makes a sound on the person receiving health
- replaced some rune sound effects
- tweaked lego grenade damage
- added "momentum" to a player jumping on a moving object (like the flying carpet in shroom)
 | what this means is, if you stand still and jump on the carpet, or another train for example
 | you will not stay moving in one spot and just fall off the train.
 | you will keep momentum with the train, and usually land right back onto it (provided it did not make any sharp turns/movements while you were in the air)
- special and time-based runes no longer spawn immediately at map load, and instead wait 30 seconds before spawning.
 | special runes wait 90 seconds. (currently only Slasher!)
- added runes.cfg
 | server operators/listen servers can use this to specify which runes are enabled/disabled on the server
 | defaults to all runes enabled

Model changes:
--------------
- Replaced/Updated Models:
 | rune stand
 | defense rune
 | homing rune

Map changes:
------------
- hd_shroom:
 | changed the flying carpet to not spin in hopes of removing sticky.
 | re-created all runespawn locations and added more
- hd_house:
 | expanded the map, added new area + a visual effect/sound for atmospheric purposes.
- hd_evil:
 | modified it, changed textures to make it a little more appealing.
 | removed from main download and created optional installer.

Visual Effects:
---------------
- New Trail effect:
 | If that you find these trails lag you (if you have an older computer) shut them off if you need to.
 | the cvar values are as follows:
  | cl_trails 0 - turn it off
  | cl_trails 1 - turn it on using default rendermode
  | cl_trails 2 - use additive rendermode (brighter)
- Added CO2 puff on soda launcher (temp sprite)

UI/Hud Changes:
-----------
- New colour scheme for launcher/console

Household DEATH! v1.1

Changes/Additions
Tony "omega" Sergi

--------------------
-lowered brooms counter-swing rate, it was too powerful
-restored default half-life blood sprites for temporary until we make new blood
-all new hud images to fix overlapping, and add full color
-fixed the crosshairs, some were compiled with the wrong blending modes
-reduced the length of the default player killed sound
-added FLFD's blood/gib code, so theres no more of the multicolored blood and blood trails look better
-moved the health/armor bobbing/rotation effect to the client-side model rendering code for optomization
-increaed the amount of health/armor the health potion and crystal give
-removed the view model glowing when you have armor
-increased knife and fork flight speeds to make it a little bit easier to hit over distances
-added 4 of the 6 initial runes: 
| Haste (adds 50% movement bonus)
| Double Damage
| Defense (gives you a 50% protection bonus AFTER armor is processed)
| Homing (makes all projectiles Home for 30 seconds then the rune vaporizes, and respawns 30 seconds or so later)
| NOTE: Rune Models/Sounds are Temporary placeholders! (some of the models MAY stay however) the rune sounds were modified from Threewave CTF for Quake as a quick insert tonight for this release!!
-fixed the one spawn point in hd_shroom so you no longer spawn in the dresser
-you can no longer kill yourself from splash damage from soda launcher OR lego
| This one needs to be evaluated, but the reason was simple: it was too easy to kill yourself with them and never hit anybody, especially with the double damage rune.
-Added map hd_evil:
| Kuja of Digital Paintball converted the CS map de_resident_evil to HHD (with permission)
| If the author still has the original RMF we will try to get it updated with textures from hd_house, plus additional improvements that couldn't be done when the map was originally created.
