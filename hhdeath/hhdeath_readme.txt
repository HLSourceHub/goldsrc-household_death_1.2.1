Household DEATH! v1.2
---------------------

Household DEATH! is a semi-comical, b-movie horrorish deathmatch mod. All of the featured weapons are items that you can find in your own home, or your neighbors, some with slight deadlier modifications!

Initially the mod is just deathmatch, but I had planned on two other modes of gameplay depending on the reception of the deathmatch mode. Another classic feature of Deathmatch that may not be in the very first version; but instead, an update a day or two later is effect rune's. Three of the four classic runes (haste, double damage, protection) are included, as well as some that I personally haven't seen before, which compliment HHD's current weapons arsenal. I am also contemplating adding another hot weapon, in the near future.
